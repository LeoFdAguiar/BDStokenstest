Test exporting tokens from Figma using the Design Tokens Plugin by Lukas Oppperman 

https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/888356646278934516/design-tokens

- first export attempt did not export primitive colors or semantic collections
- plugin seems to not gather data from variables table only from style and frames in canvas
- need to read documentation more
